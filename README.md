# Random-Password-Generator
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    My motivation was to make a random password generator that would be able to allow the user to choose from a prompt, which characters and how long the password would be. 

- Why did you build this project?
    It was an opportunity to apply what I have learned in my class and apply it to a porject.

- What problem does it solve?
    Problems within the code that solved were figuring out how to store the final password into an array, how to ensure that the password contained all of the criteria that the user wanted. As well as ensuring that the user was able to control how many characters went into the password. 

- What did you learn?
    I learned how to implements basics of JavaScripts into a new file. I learned about the console.log and how useful it can be in troubeshooting my javascript. I also learned about storing data in an empty array.
